### Problem Statement
Find the dimensions of a rectangle with maximum area located under the curve $y = 3 - x^2$ in the first quadrant.


### Mathematical Model
Let the corner of the rectangle on the curve be $(x, y)$.
•⁠  ⁠*Width:* $x$
•⁠  ⁠*Height:* $y = 3 - x^2$
•⁠  ⁠*Area ($A$):* $A(x) = x \cdot (3 - x^2) = 3x - x^3$

*Step 1: Find the derivative $A'(x)$*
$$A'(x) = 3 - 3x^2$$

*Step 2: Find the critical point*
Set $A'(x) = 0$:
$$3 - 3x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1$$
(Note: x = -1 is ignored as it is not in the first quadrant).

*Step 3: Find the corresponding height*
$$y = 3 - (1)^2 = 2$$


### Final Result
The dimensions for the maximum area are *$x = 1$* and *$y = 2$. The maximum area is **2*.
